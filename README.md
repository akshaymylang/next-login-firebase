# NextJS Basic Login with Firebase

This is a basic [Next.js](https://nextjs.org) template that uses [Next-Auth](https://next-auth.js.org) and [Firebase](https://firebase.google.com) to authenticate users and shows my GitHub repos.

## Things required

Follow these steps

- You need to create a project inside `firebase.google.com` and after that, visit `https://console.developers.google.com/apis/credentials` but make sure to select the project that you have created in `firebase` before.

- And then click the `web client` under `OAuth 2.0 Client IDs` and you will find your `client and secrets` there.

- Next you will have to add the deployed or local frontend link in the field under the `Authorized JavaScript origins`. for instance, `http://localhost:3000`.

- And add `http://localhost:3000/api/auth/callback/google` under the `Authorized redirect URIs`

Save it.

## Make it yours

You can make it yours by creating a `.env` file and getting the `Client ID and Secret` by following the steps mentioned in the [next-auth docs](https://next-auth.js.org/providers/) because they are descriptive and well-documented.

```bash

GOOGLE_CLIENT_ID=

GOOGLE_CLIENT_SECRET=

NEXT_PUBLIC_GITHUB_REPO_URL="api.github.com/users/<username>/repos"

```
