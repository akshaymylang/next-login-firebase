## Things required

Follow these steps

- You need to create a project inside `firebase.google.com` and after that, visit `https://console.developers.google.com/apis/credentials` but make sure to select the project that you have created in `firebase` before.

- And then click the `web client` under `OAuth 2.0 Client IDs` and you will find your `client and secrets` there.

- Next you will have to add the deployed or local frontend link in the field under the `Authorized JavaScript origins`. for instance, `http://localhost:3000`.

Save it.
